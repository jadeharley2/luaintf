Well! Um...My parents and I grew up outside the big city. 
They were both bakers, even my uncle, who owned an old-fashioned one downtown, in central Kan Rein. 
That's where Nytro lives and works too! When my uncle passed, around when I turned 18, I asked to move in and take it over so it wouldn't get closed...it's tough stuff. 
But Nyt and some others help me out with it...But! Anyway! 
I just really like baking. Sorry it's so simple..whuff.
